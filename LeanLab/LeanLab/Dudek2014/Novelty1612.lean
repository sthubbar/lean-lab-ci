AI wrote the Lean code, Claude, unit U-1612, run 20261103T0803Z-22341, NOVELTY triage.
Binary Goldbach is OPEN. Tag: IMPROVEMENT, an input removed on a finite range. Not original: the
method is the maximal gap table, KNOWN, as in `Dudek2014/MaxGap.lean`.

Source of the claim: research/novelty/Dudek2014-deepseek-20261102T0837Z.md, section 6 item 1, which
claims Dudek's Theorem 3 interval `(x - (1 + ε) √x log x, x]` holds without RH for
`X₀(ε) ≤ x < 4e18`, with a separate check below `X₀(ε)`. Test scripts/dudek_gap.py: true, and much
more is true. With ε = 0 it holds on all of `[2, 3999999999999999761)`, and the least constant
that can work is `2 / (√5 log 5) = 0.55574`, from the gap 3 to 5 as `x` tends to 5 from below.

`dudek_interval_one` is PROVED CONDITIONAL ON `MaxGap1476`, the Oliveira e Silva, Herzog, Pardi
table, cited. `dudek_interval_0556` is the sealed target, sorry, the sharp constant to 3 places.
`not_primeInC_055` is PROVED: 0.55 fails at `x = 4.99`, with no hypothesis.

CMS, Carneiro, Milinovich, Soundararajan 2019, constant 22/25, is about a different interval
`[x, x + c √x log x]` and needs RH, so nothing here compares with it on an infinite range.
