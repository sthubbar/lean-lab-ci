Section 2 of the paper in full: Theorem 2.3 with the paper's Jacobi hypothesis, and the
converse the paper prints right after it, that for a prime N the congruence
a^((N-1)/2) = -1 mod N holds for EVERY a whose Jacobi symbol over N is -1. Together with the
existence of a quadratic nonresidue mod an odd prime this gives the full Proth criterion:
a Proth number is prime if and only if some a has Jacobi symbol -1 and a^((N-1)/2) = -1.

The converse is Euler's criterion; the existence of a nonresidue is a finite field fact;
both come from Mathlib. Nothing here is new mathematics.
