The ladder reduction in its sharp form and Theorem 4.1 from the paper's own range structure.

1. Sharp gap: binary Goldbach to B plus odd prime rungs with every gap at most B - 2, not B - 4
   as in Ladder.lean, already gives ternary Goldbach to the top rung plus B. The gap B - 2 is
   exactly what the paper's Section 3 algorithm yields: it takes the largest Proth prime strictly
   below N0 + Δ, and two odd numbers differing by less than an even Δ differ by at most Δ - 2.
   With Δ = 4e18 this is the binary bound of P0005 exactly, with no room to spare.
2. Section 4 range structure: T = 492700 ranges of width W = 2^54 · 10^9; in each range a ladder
   that starts at most 2e18 above the left end point and ends strictly within 2e18 of the right
   end point. Theorem 4.1 follows from binary Goldbach to 4e18 and these 492700 ladders alone,
   with no lower ternary range, since the junction between ranges is itself a gap below 4e18.
   No ordering of the ranges or inclusion of a ladder in its range is needed.
3. The cited corollary names the lab's P0005 input `LeanLab.Verifications.oesilva_even`.
