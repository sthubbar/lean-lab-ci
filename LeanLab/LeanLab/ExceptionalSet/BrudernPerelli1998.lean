Ann. Inst. Fourier 48 (1998), https://aif.centre-mersenne.org/item/10.5802/aif.1621.pdf,
read through a text extraction of the scan; QUESTIONs in STATEMENTS.md.

* Theorem 1: for 1 < γ < 3/2, the number E_γ(N) of n ≤ N such that
  |p₁ + p₂ − exp((log n)^γ)| < 1 has no solution in odd primes satisfies
  E_γ(N) ≪ N exp(−c (log N)^{3−2γ}) for some c > 0. CITED with sorry.
* PROVED, zero sorry: Theorem 1 gives density zero; a solution gives an even Goldbach number,
  a sum of two odd primes, within distance 1 of exp((log n)^γ), and that even integer is unique,
  our reading of the paper's remark that almost all of its even neighbours ṽ_n are Goldbach
  numbers; the abstract itself says only for almost all n.
* Theorem 2, the exponential sum bound, is not stated: its α range was not legible.
