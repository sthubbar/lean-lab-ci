P0088 A. V. Kumchev, J. Y. Liu, "Sums of primes and squares of primes in short intervals",
arXiv 0801.0130, v1 read 2026-10-17.
H2 is the set of even n with n not congruent to 1 mod 3, H3 the set of n with n congruent to
3 mod 24 and 5 not dividing n. E2(X) counts n in H2, n ≤ X, not of the form p1 + p2^2;
E3(X) counts n in H3, n ≤ X, not of the form p1^2 + p2^2 + p3^2; E4(X) counts n ≤ X with
n congruent to 4 mod 24, not a sum of four squares of primes.
Theorem 2: for fixed A > 0 and X^0.33 ≤ H ≤ X, E2(X+H) - E2(X) ≪ H (log X)^{-A}.
Theorem 3: for fixed A > 0 and X^{7/20} ≤ H ≤ X, E3(X+H) - E3(X) ≪ H (log X)^{-A}.
Corollary 1: for fixed A > 0 and X^0.27 ≤ H ≤ X, E4(X+H) - E4(X) ≪ H (log X)^{-A}.
Theorem 1, an asymptotic formula for R2(n), is not encoded: its R2 and r2 depend on a
parameter Y = X^θ1 that the paper fixes only inside the proof. Its stated consequence,
(2) for H ≥ X^{7/18+ε}, is derived below from Theorem 2.
