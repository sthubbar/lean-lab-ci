P0009 BJS 2022, Lemma 32's `m(X₃)` with Lemma 29's `v₀(X₃)` and `β₀` from (91), at the lab's
corrected Section 9 parameters: `X₃ = X₂^{1/8}`, `log log X₂ = 32.8`, `δ = 1.476`.

Notation: `Λ₃ = log X₃ = e^{32.8}/8`; `ℓ = log x₂(X₃) = Λ₃ - 15 log Λ₃`, (75); `K = ℓ^δ` is
`log^δ x₂`; `ν = min(100/(√K log² K), 1/(2 R₁ log Q₁(x₂)))`, `log Q₁(x₂) = 10 ℓ`, (91);
`β₀ = 1 - ν`. For `y ≥ x₂(X₃)` write `Y = log y`; the bracket of (72) is
`φ(Y) = 3.2e-8/Y⁴ + Y⁴ (y^{β₀-1}/β₀ + 1.02 log¹⁰ y/√y + 3 log¹⁰ y/y^{2/3})`, `Ind_k = 1`, worst case.

PROVED: `phi_le`, `φ(Y) ≤ 2.7·10⁻¹³` for every `Y ≥ ℓ`, so `v'₀(X₃) ≤ 2.7·10⁻¹³`; and
`m_le`, `m(X₃) ≤ 2·10⁻¹¹` for the formula of Lemma 32 with that `v'`. Python gives `1.23·10⁻¹¹`.
The heart is `ν ℓ ≥ 152`, true value 152.3, against `4 log ℓ ≈ 122.88`.
