AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18, run 20261018T0803Z-19871, unit U-0930.
P0009 Bordignon-Johnston-Starichkova 2022, arXiv 2207.09452 v6, read in Claude in Chrome:
the constant a(X₂) of (138), with c₃(X₂) of (129) and a₁(X₂) of (139), at
X₂ = exp(exp 32.713), δ = 1.47694.

Why: Section9Link.lean's `margin_b_X2` took `a(X₂) ≤ 10⁻²⁰` as a hypothesis, TESTED in the
2026-10-18 Python model, but that model never computed a(X₂). It is about 1.16e-19,
numerics/aX2_U0930.py, because a(X₂) carries the factor log log log N / log^δ N, about
e^{-48.4}, not a power of X₂. The hypothesis was false; Section9.lean now takes
`a ≤ 10⁻¹⁸`, and the margin still closes. This file PROVES a(X₂) ≤ 10⁻¹⁸, given the c₂ term
of (139) below 10⁻²⁰, which is X₂-only like the other hypotheses.

Everything is written in t = log log N, so N = exp(exp t), log N = L = exp t, and
log x₁ = L - 5t by (75). `log log (log^δ x₁)` is `log (δ · log (log x₁))` and
`log log (log^{10} x₁)` is `log (10 · log (log x₁))`. The product ∏_{p>2} (p-1)²/(p(p-2)) is
1/T with T the twin prime constant ∏_{p>2} (1 - 1/(p-1)²), taken here as a parameter with
T ≥ 0.65, which `TwinCNumeric.twinC_ge_065` proves.
