AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-20, CLOUD 20261020T1217Z-cloud42, unit U-6403, track T1: a scripted port by gen/port3270_U6403.py of the 32.716 file of PC U-1045 to the printed log log X₂ = 32.7, α = 10⁻⁵, with δ₁ = 1.478 for Theorems 44 and 50 and δ₂ = 1.445 for Theorem 51, ε₀ = 2·10⁻⁵, m(X₃) ≤ 10⁻¹¹; numeric lemmas retightened where the build required. The 32.716 header follows, its numbers updated by the same script.
AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-19, run 20261019T0903Z-22821, built in the cloud workspace for the PC lab,
unit U-1045, track T2. A scripted port of At3272.lean, PC run 20261019T0703Z-249, U-1041, itself a port
of At3273.lean of U-0988.
Changes against At3272.lean, all checked by the build: log log X₂ = 32.7; ε₀ = 1.37·10⁻⁴ → 2·10⁻⁵,
the optimum for the larger m; the m(X₃) hypothesis 3.4·10⁻¹⁰ → 10⁻¹¹, proved in BJSm3270.lean.
Lean-side case (b) slack about 3.7·10⁻⁴ at g = 1.781, by exact rational arithmetic on the bounds.
P0009 BJS 2022, arXiv 2207.09452v6, Section 9 with Theorems 44 (b), 50 (b), 51 CORRECTED per
F-0020 to F-0022, case (b), at log log X₂ = 32.7.

This file is Section9.lean's case (b) proof on the parametrized definitions `cAbP`, `cBP` of
F0023.lean, which `cAb_eq`, `cB_eq` there tie by rfl to the VERIFIED Section9 forms.

PROVED: `margin_bP`, case (b) at least 2·10⁻⁴ + 10⁻¹² at log log X₂ = 32.7, for every
log N ≥ log X₂, CONDITIONAL ON the numeric inputs as hypotheses: ε₁ ≤ 1/57, ε₂ ≤ 1/51,
m(X₃) ≤ 10⁻¹¹, the X₂-only constants a ≤ 10⁻¹⁸ and c₄*, l₁*, l* ≤ 10⁻²⁰, w ≤ log N, and the
integral bound; AssemblyT3270.lean discharges every one. Chen's theorem is not in doubt; Goldbach is open.
