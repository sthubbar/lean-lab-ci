AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18, CLOUD session 20261018T2315Z-cloud11, unit U-5023,
taking up the REQUEST U-0977: harden FINDING F-0023 by moving its Python margin model into Lean.
P0009 Bordignon, Johnston, Starichkova 2022, arXiv 2207.09452v6, Section 9.

The Section9.lean definitions are written for the lab's own parameters, `log log X₂ = 32.8` and
`ε₀ = 3·10⁻⁵`. Here the same formulas take `log log X₂` and `ε₀` as arguments, `cAbP` and `cBP`,
and `cAb_eq`, `cB_eq` check by `rfl` that the old definitions are the instances at 32.8 and
3·10⁻⁵; likewise `mX3P`, `φP` against BJSmX3.lean. So nothing is retyped from the paper here.

At the PRINTED Section 9 parameters `X₂ = exp(exp 32.7)`, `δ = 1.478`, `α = 10⁻⁵`,
`ε₀ = 10⁻⁴`, with `X₃ = X₂^{1/8}` and Theorems 44 (b), 50 (b), 51 as corrected per F-0021 and
F-0022, PROVED:
- `pbar1_printed`, `pbar2_printed`: `p̄ = 59` at `x₁(X₂)` and `p̄ = 53` at `x₂(X₃)`, so
  `ε₁ = 1/57` and `ε₂ = 1/51` exactly by (121);
- `m_ge`: `m(X₃) ≥ 10⁻⁸` for every `v ≥ φ(log x₂(X₃))`, in particular the supremum `v'₀(X₃)` of
  (72); Python gives `m(X₃) ≈ 1.21·10⁻⁸`. The heart is `ν ℓ ≤ 144.5`, true value 144.37;
- `f0023_printed`: the case (b) combination `cA - cQ/2 - cB/2` is below `-6·10⁻³` for every
  `log N ≥ log X₂` and every admissible value of the X₂-only constants `a, c₄*, w, l₁*, l*`,
  each only assumed nonnegative. The paper needs at least `2·10⁻⁴`. Python gives `-8.16·10⁻³`.

`X₃` is taken as `X₂^{1/8}`, `log log X₃ = 30.62056`, where Section 9 prints `X₃ = exp(exp 30.62)`.
The printed `X₃` is slightly smaller, so `m(X₃)` is larger, about `1.228·10⁻⁸` against `1.212·10⁻⁸`,
and the combination about `-8.28·10⁻³`; the choice here favours the paper, but the theorem below
is literally about `X₃ = X₂^{1/8}`. VERIFY subagent, same session: AGREE, all formulas MATCH.

This is a Lean proof that the paper's Section 9 inequality, case (b), fails at its printed
parameters once F-0021 and F-0022 are corrected. It concerns only the explicit threshold
exp(exp(32.7)) of Theorem 3; Chen's theorem itself is not in doubt, and Goldbach is open.
What the proof rests on: the lab's transcription of Theorems 44 (b), 50 (b), 51 in Section9.lean,
checked against the alttext in U-0920 and U-0923, and the corrections F-0021, F-0022; the reading
of `ν` at `x₂(X₃)` in `m(X₃)`, the one most favourable to the paper.
