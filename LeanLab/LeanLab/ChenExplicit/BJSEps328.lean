P0009 BJS 2022, (121) at the lab's corrected Section 9 parameters `log log X₂ = 32.8`,
`X₃ = X₂^{1/8}`, `δ = 1.476`. PROVED: `pbar1_328`, `3·5·…·59 ≤ (log x₁(X₂))^δ`, so `p̄ ≥ 59` and
`ε₁ ≤ 1/57`; `pbar2_328`, `3·5·…·53 ≤ (log x₂(X₃))^δ < 3·5·…·59`, so `p̄ = 53` and `ε₂ = 1/51`.
These are the `ε₁`, `ε₂` hypotheses of Section9Link.lean.
