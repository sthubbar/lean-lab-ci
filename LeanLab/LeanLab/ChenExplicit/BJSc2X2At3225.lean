P0009 BJS 2022, arXiv 2207.09452 v6, read in Claude in Chrome: Lemma 33 c₁(X₂), c(X₂) with
display (97); (127) c₂(X₂); and the first max of (139), the c₂ term of a₁(X₂). At
X₂ = exp(exp 32.3), δ = 1.496, R₁ = 2.0452.

PROVED: c₁(X₂) ≤ 10⁻³⁰, c₂(X₂) ≤ 10⁻²⁷, and the c₂ term of (139) ≤ 10⁻²⁰, so BJSaLink.lean's
last X₂-only analytic hypothesis besides l₁, l₁* is discharged. Reading choices, as in
BJSpX2.lean: y ≥ x₁(X₂) is written L = log y; y^{-a} = exp(-a L), Q₁(y) = L¹⁰,
y^{2/3} = exp(2L/3); the max over y is the supremum over L ≥ log x₁(X₂). In (139) N is written
t = log log N, as in BJSaX2At3230.lean, with log^{10} x₁(N) = (exp t - 5t)^{10}.
