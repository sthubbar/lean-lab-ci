AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18, run 20261018T0903Z-17311, unit U-0931.
P0009 BJS 2022, arXiv 2207.09452 v6, read in Claude in Chrome: (158) l₁(X₂) and (159) l₁*(X₂)
at X₂ = exp(exp 32.8), with α₂ = 10⁻⁵, k_{α₂} = 8(1/6 - α₂) by (155), ε = 1.452·10⁻⁷ and h of (7)
as in Section9.lean. C₁(ε) of Table 1 is a parameter here: the bound holds for every
0 ≤ C₁ ≤ 10⁶; Section9.lean's `l2` uses C₁(ε) = 106. X₂^{1/8} is written exp(LX/8).

PROVED: l₁(X₂), l₁*(X₂) ≤ 10⁻²⁰, so every X₂-only constant of Section 9 is now PROVED small.
