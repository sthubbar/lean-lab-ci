The header below is an older one; the code is authoritative.

P0009 BJS 2022, (121) at log log X₂ = 32.3 with the two δ of the U-6404 model, written from
Eps3270.lean and F0023.pbar1_printed of cloud42:
* `eps1_3230`: `ε₁ = 1/57` at δ₁ = 1.496, since `3·5·…·59 ≤ (log x₁(X₂))^{1.496} < 3·5·…·61`,
  `log x₁(X₂) = e^{32.3} - 5 · 32.3`; the lower side is `1.496 · (32.3 - 10⁻⁴) ≥ 48.3206` against
  `log(3·5·…·59) = 48.3149`, the boundary is `δ₁ = 1.49582`;
* `eps2_3230`: `ε₂ = 1/51` at δ₂ = 1.464 for Theorem 51, since `3·5·…·53 ≤ (log x₂(X₃))^{1.464} <
  3·5·…·59`; the lower side is `1.464 · log x₂(X₃) ≥ 44.2428` against `log(3·5·…·53) = 44.2374`,
  the boundary is `δ₂ = 1.46382`. Theorem 51 states its own "Let 0 < δ < 2", papers/P0009.txt
  line 3327, so δ₂ need not be δ₁.
Chen's theorem is not in doubt; Goldbach is open.
