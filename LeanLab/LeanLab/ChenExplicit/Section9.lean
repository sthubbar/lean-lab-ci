AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18, run 20261018T0704Z-6940, unit U-0923.
P0009 BJS 2022, arXiv 2207.09452v6, Section 9 with the constants of Theorems 44, 50 and 51
CORRECTED per FINDINGS F-0020, F-0021, F-0022: `e^{γ}` in Theorem 44 (a), the remainder factor
`(2e^{-γ}∏)⁻¹ = g/(2T)` in Theorems 50 and 51, `ε₂` at `x₂(X₃)`.

Parameters, the lab's choice, not the paper's: `log log X₂ = 32.8`, `X₃ = X₂^{1/8}`,
`δ = 1.476`, `α₁ = α₂ = α₃ = 10⁻⁵`, `ε₀ = 3·10⁻⁵`. At these the inputs are, by the lab's
Python check: `ε₁ = 1/57`, `ε₂ = 1/51`, `m(X₃) ≈ 1.23·10⁻¹¹`.

Notation: `L = log N ≥ LX = log X₂ = e^{32.8}`, `g = e^{γ}`, `T` the twin prime constant,
`cb = c̄` of Lemma 52, so `U_N⁻¹ ≤ (2 e^{-γ} T)⁻¹ = g / (2T)`. The tiny X₂-only constants
`l₁, l₁*, l, l*, c₄, c₄*, a(X₂)` and the factor `w` of Theorem 44 (b) are parameters with
numeric hypotheses, to be proved in later units, as is `m(X₃) ≤ 2·10⁻¹¹`.

PROVED here: `margin_a` and `margin_b`, each case's combination `cA - cQ/2 - cB/2` is at least
`2·10⁻⁴ + 10⁻¹²`, the Section9Margin of Assembly.lean, from `0.5772 < γ < 0.57722`
(GammaBounds), `∫_2^3 log(t-1)/t ≤ 0.1476` (FIntegral), `c̄ < 0.363084` (BJSCbar),
`T ≥ 0.65` (TwinCNumeric) and the hypotheses above. Goldbach is open; this is about the
explicit constant in Chen's theorem.
