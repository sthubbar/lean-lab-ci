Written from AssemblyT3270.lean of cloud42 U-6403 by gen/port3230_U6602.py; the ε₁ and ε₂ inputs by hand.
P0009 BJS 2022 Theorem 3 at exp(exp 32.3), below the printed exp(exp 32.7), from the lab's corrected
Section 9, with two values of δ re-chosen at the boundaries of the U-6404 model: δ₁ = 1.496 for the k₁
split of Theorems 44 and 50, so ε₁ = 1/57 by Eps3230.eps1_3230 and the X₂-only constants of BJSpX2At3230
and friends; and δ₂ = 1.464 for Theorem 51, which states its own "Let 0 < δ < 2", papers/P0009.txt
line 3327, so ε₂ = 1/51 by Eps3230.eps2_3230 and m(X₃) ≤ 10⁻¹¹ by BJSm3230.lean, Python m ≈ 8.8·10⁻¹².
α₁ = α₂ = α₃ = 10⁻⁵ as printed, ε₀ = 2·10⁻⁵. The model of U-6404 at α = 10⁻⁵ gives case (b) slack
about 4.4·10⁻⁴ over 2·10⁻⁴ at 32.3, and α = 10⁻⁵ is above the smallest admissible α ≈ 9.4·10⁻⁶ there.

`chen_3230` is CONDITIONAL ON BJS Theorems 44 and 50 at δ₁ = 1.496 and Theorem 51 at δ₂ = 1.464, all at
α = 10⁻⁵ with their constants CORRECTED per FINDINGS F-0020, F-0021, F-0022, and on the paper's range
conditions at these parameters, which the Thm44At, Thm50At and Thm51At hypotheses carry. So, if those
hold, every even N > exp(exp 32.3) has more than 2·10⁻⁴ U_N N / log² N representations as a prime plus a
number with at most two prime factors. Chen's theorem is not in doubt; Goldbach is open.
