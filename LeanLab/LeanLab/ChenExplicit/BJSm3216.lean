P0009 BJS 2022, Lemma 32's `m(X₃)` at the lab's corrected Section 9 parameters moved to
`log log X₂ = 32.3`, `δ = 1.464`, `X₃ = X₂^{1/8}`: BJSmX3.lean, run 20261018T0704Z-6940, with the
constants changed and the numeric lemmas retightened. The input `m(X₃) ≤ 10⁻¹¹` of
At3230.margin_bP and margin_aP.

Notation as in BJSmX3: `Λ₃ = e^{32.3}/8`, `ℓ = Λ₃ - 15 log Λ₃`, `K = ℓ^δ`, `ν` of (91), `β₀ = 1 - ν`.
PROVED: `phi_le`, `φ(Y) ≤ 3·10⁻¹⁹` for every `Y ≥ ℓ`; `m_le`, `m(X₃) ≤ 10⁻¹¹` for any `v` in
`[0, 3·10⁻¹⁹]`. Python, mpmath, CLOUD 20261020T1217Z-cloud42: at δ = 1.464, `ν ℓ ≈ 168`, `φ(ℓ) ≈ 10⁻²⁰`, `m ≈ 8.8·10⁻¹²`,
the floor 39·3/Λ₃. The heart is `ν ℓ ≥ 165` against `4 log ℓ ≈ 120.88`.
Chen's theorem is not in doubt; Goldbach is open.
