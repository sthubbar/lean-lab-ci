PORT to log log X₂ = 32.73, δ = 1.4762, CLOUD 20261019T0114Z-cloud13, unit U-5042, from BJSpX2.lean by
script /tmp port3273.py: every 32.8 → 32.73, 1.476 → 1.4762; numeric lemmas retightened where
the build failed, listed in PROGRESS.md. Original header follows.
AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18, run 20261018T0903Z-17311, unit U-0931.
P0009 Bordignon-Johnston-Starichkova 2022, arXiv 2207.09452 v6, read in Claude in Chrome
from arxiv.org/html/2207.09452: Lemma 31 with (87), the constants p₁(X₂), p(X₂); (75), (76),
(80) 𝓔(y), (81) ν(x₁), β₀(x₁); Lemma 34 with (99) β₀*(x₁) for p*(X₂); (134), (135) c₄(X₂),
c₄*(X₂); (156), (157) l(X₂), l*(X₂). All at X₂ = exp(exp 32.73), δ = 1.4762, R₁ = 2.0452.

What this file PROVES: p(X₂), p*(X₂) ≤ 10⁻²⁴ and c₄, c₄*, l, l* ≤ 10⁻²⁰, unconditionally,
for the formulas as printed. Reading choices, recorded in STATEMENTS.md:
* y in the max of (87) runs over the reals y ≥ x₁(X₂); we write L = log y, so y = exp L,
  y^β = exp(β L), log Q₁(y) = log(L¹⁰), log x₁(y) = L - 5 log L by (75).
* β₀(x₁) in (87) is read at x₁ = x₁(X₂), the reading the lab's Python used; see the QUESTION
  of run 20261018T0803Z-19871 in STATEMENTS.md. The bound holds for every ν in `Good`, which
  covers both ν(x₁(X₂)) of (81) and ν* of (99).
* Half-integer powers are written with √: log^{9/2} y = L⁴√L, log^{5.5} y = L⁵√L,
  log^{1/2} y = √L, log^{11/2} y = L⁵√L, √x₁ = √(exp log x₁).
* (87) is a max over an unbounded set; it is taken here as the supremum `⨆ L ≥ log x₁(X₂)`,
  which the bound shows is finite.
