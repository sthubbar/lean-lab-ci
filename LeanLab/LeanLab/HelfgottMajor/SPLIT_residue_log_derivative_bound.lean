Split of the open logarithmic derivative bound of the residue in
`LeanLab.HelfgottMajor.Gaussian123Base`, displays 4.18 to 4.22 and the display before 4.23,
pages 36 and 37. The sealed statement bounds
`log (2 * π / q) + γ - L'(1, χ)/L(1, χ)` by `3 log q + 15.289` for a primitive character modulo
`q` with `q` not equal to `1`. The four leaves are the quotient itself, the scalar logarithm,
the numerical constant of page 37, and the conductor reduction to `3 ≤ q`;
`residue_log_derivative_bound_split` assembles them with the triangle inequality.
The namespace is the target's, so the names the rest of the lab refers to are unchanged.

/-- LEAF: step 1 of 4, the quotient on its own. Pages 36 and 37, displays 4.18 to 4.22 and the
display before 4.23: for a primitive character modulo `q` with `q` not equal to `1`, the norm of
`L'(1, χ)/L(1, χ)` is at most `2 log q + 15.07017`. The scalar logarithm of the sealed statement
is absent from this inequality; it is one of the two terms of the residue. -/

/-- LEAF: step 2 of 4, the scalar logarithm. Page 37: for a real `q` at least `3`, the absolute
value of `log (2π/q) + γ` is at most `log q + (γ + log 2π - log 9)`. This is the elementary
comparison of `2π` with `q ^ 2` and of `9` with `q ^ 2`, losing one power of `log q` and no
more. No character and no `L` function occurs in it. -/
