P0014 Theorem 1.1, page 3, proof on pages 56 and 57.
AI wrote this Lean code. Binary Goldbach is open.
The lab uses the Fourier transform of the weight extended by zero to negative arguments.
The analytic leaf uses the recorded repair of Proposition 4.6 on pages 43 and 44.
The final assembly is CONDITIONAL ON HelfgottInput and the analytic leaf.

The analytic input is not formalized. Its proof uses Lemmas 4.1, 4.4 and 4.5.
Lemma 4.1 in turn uses the explicit formula and the Landau estimate in Lemma 4.2,
whose outside source is Montgomery and Vaughan, Multiplicative Number Theory I, Lemma 6.3.
