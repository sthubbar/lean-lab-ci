P0014 H. A. Helfgott, Major arcs for Goldbach's problem, arXiv 1305.2897v4, Prop. 4.8, pages 46
and 47, the smoothing `η(t) = t² e^{-t²/2}`: its norms (4.50) and the coefficients of (4.52) that
come from Lemma 4.4's bound (4.29). Unit U-6062, CLOUD 20261020T0516Z-cloud35; Python in
numerics/sec45_check.py.

FINDING, cosmetic: (4.29) with (4.50) gives the coefficient `17.21 |η · log|₂ − log(2π√e) |η|₂`
of `√T₀` equal to 5.05585, while Prop. 4.8 prints 5.053; `coef_sqrtT0_gt` proves it exceeds 5.055,
so the printed 5.053 does not follow. The book version, arXiv 1501.05438, prints 5.056 in the
proposition, `coef_sqrtT0_le` proves that one, but still writes 5.053 in its Section 9.6 display.
The Theorem 1.2 constant survives: `thm12_survives`, against `printed_275263_fails`.
