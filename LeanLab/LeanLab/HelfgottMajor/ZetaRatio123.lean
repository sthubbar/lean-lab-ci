P0014, Helfgott, Major arcs for Goldbach's problem, Lemma 4.2, page 37: the numerical
constant c = 5 log(2 sqrt 3 zeta(9/8)/zeta(9/4)). This file proves the enclosure
zeta(9/8)/zeta(9/4) ≤ 5.880137 that the constant needs, the leaf
`Residue123.zeta_ratio_le`. True value 5.8801339.

Method: zeta(s) is the sum of n^(-s) for real s > 1. The tail past N is bounded above
by the midpoint rule and below by the trapezoid rule, both from the tangent line
inequality of x^(-s), and the first N terms are enclosed by certified decimals.
