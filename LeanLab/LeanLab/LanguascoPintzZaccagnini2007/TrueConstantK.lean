# F-0038 for `k = 2, 3, 4`: the corrected constant `2c₀ C(k, N)` leaves `[1, 2]`

Languasco, Pintz, Zaccagnini, Bull. LMS 39, 2007, version of record `papers/P0045-journal.pdf`.
(23), p. 777: `C(k, N) = Σ'_{d ≥ 1} f(d) j(d, k, N)/ξ(d)^k` over odd squarefree `d`. The Theorem,
p. 772, claims `C(k, N) ∈ [1, 2]`, but the proof drops the factor `2c₀ = 2 twinC` of (2), so the
asymptotic constant the proof gives is `2c₀ C(k, N)`. TrueConstant.lean treats `k = 1`; this file
treats `k = 2, 3, 4`.

`Ck k N` is the paper's `C(k, N)`; the paper's `j(d, k, N)` is `jcount d (k - 1) N` of Links.lean.
`Ck_summable` by comparison with the series (26), PROVED as `lemma61_proved`, through
`jcount_le`. The count `jcount` is turned into the recursion `Gcount`, a sum over the first
exponent, and evaluated by the kernel on each residue class. Certificates, all exact:

* `k = 2`, `N ≡ 6 mod 15`: `d = 1, 3, 5` give `C(2, N) ≥ 1.5625`.
* `k = 3`, `N ≡ 791 mod 1155`: `d = 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 11` give `C(3, N) ≥ 1.5451`.
* `k = 4`, `N ≡ 13035 mod 15015`: `d = 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 11, 13, 33` give
  `C(4, N) ≥ 1.5395`.

Each exceeds `20/13`, so with `twinC_ge_065` the corrected constant `2c₀ C(k, N)` is above `2`
on a residue class of positive density. That the corrected constant is the true one rests on the
repaired chain, CONDITIONAL ON its cited inputs. Binary Goldbach is OPEN.
