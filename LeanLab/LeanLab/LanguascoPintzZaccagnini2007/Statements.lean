P0045 A. Languasco, J. Pintz, A. Zaccagnini, "On the sum of two primes and k powers of two",
last preprint of Bull. London Math. Soc. 39 (2007) 771-780, read 2026-10-18 from papers/P0045.pdf,
pages 1 to 10, the Theorem on page 2 checked on the rendered page image.
AI-written Lean code, Claude, 2026-10-18. Checked only by the Lean kernel.
Binary Goldbach is OPEN. The Theorem is an almost-all result for two primes and k powers of 2.

Readings. `X` is a natural number, `L = log_2 X` as in the paper, powers of two run over
`ν ∈ [1, ⌊L⌋]`. `R''_k(N)` is the Λ-weighted count of page 2. `(log X)^10` is the natural logarithm,
the base only changes the implied constant. `C(k, N)` is the series (23) of page 8; the paper's proof
makes it, and the implied constant, independent of η, so the Theorem is read with `∃ C K` before `∀ η`.
`ξ(d) = min {μ ≥ 1 : 2^μ ≡ 1 mod d}` for odd `d`, page 7 (μ ≥ 1 so that ξ(1) = 1).

with no lower bound on `r`, it is false at `r = 1`: VERIFY U-0999, run 20261019T0202Z-9877,
