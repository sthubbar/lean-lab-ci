/-- LEAF. P0093 page 168 last inequality in equation 10.5. The standard
small power bound for the divisor count used there, with exponent three
hundredths. This is independent of the singular series and its cutoff. -/

tail saving gives exponent negative two hundredths, which is stronger than
the negative one hundredth requested by singular_tail357. -/
