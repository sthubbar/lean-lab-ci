Split of the absolute central Mellin kernel mass of Decomp442a.lean.
The parent statement central_kernel_mass442 asks for an integrable
absolute Gamma weighted kernel on the central interval and for its mass
to be at most a constant times square root N times the cube of log N.
The leaves below are the steps of that computation and nothing else:
the modulus of the power factor, the split of a logarithm of a product,
the twisted Gamma mass, the integrability of the weighted kernel, and the
bookkeeping of the constant. central_kernel_mass442_split reassembles
them into the parent statement without using the parent theorem.

The only point of care is the power factor. The base of the kernel power
has real part one over N and imaginary part at most eight pi over N, so
the ratio of its parts is at most eight pi and the imaginary part of its
logarithm is bounded away from pi over two by a fixed gap. That gap is
what keeps the exponential of the Gamma factor away from the Gamma decay,
and it is the reason the mass is finite at all.

For N at least two and alpha at most four over N the base of the power has
real part one over N and imaginary part at most eight pi over N, so the
imaginary part of its logarithm is at most pi over two minus one over
sixteen pi; its modulus is at least one over N, and N to the power a half
plus one over log N is at most e times the square root of N. No Gamma

/-- LEAF. Third step of the parent proof, the twisted Gamma mass. The
Gamma factor on the line, weighted by the exponential gap of the power
factor and by the cube of the logarithm of the sum of absolute t and two,
is integrable for every N at least two, and both of its integrals are at
most one constant independent of N and of alpha. This is the analytic core
of the parent proof and the only place where the decay of Gamma is used. -/

/-- LEAF. Fourth step of the parent proof, the integrability half of the
parent conclusion. The modulus of the kernel times the cube of the
logarithm of N times the sum of absolute t and two is integrable, for N at
least thirty two and alpha at most four over N. This is the first
conjunct of the parent statement on its own, without any estimate of the
integral. -/
