P0093 page 161, the sentence after equation 6.3: the relative estimate of the convolution
sum of 1 over ln m ln m prime over m plus m prime equal to n.
Burst 8 p3 port, AI wrote the Lean code. Binary Goldbach is open.

The lab proves this cleanly as log_convolution_estimate487 in Decomp487c, from
SPLIT1622_major, SPLIT_log_convolution_estimate1622 and SPLIT_logConv_excess1622. Those
modules sit downstream of Decomp111, so this file copies the needed declarations with the
same proofs, renamed with the suffix _lc111, on top of Mathlib only.
