/-- P0093 page 168 equation 10.7, uniform residual weight comparison.
For every positive C and epsilon, the residual weight times C log N
to one quarter is at most epsilon N over log squared N, uniformly
for residuals from two through N once N is large. Split the residual
at square root N. There is no singular coefficient in this statement. -/
